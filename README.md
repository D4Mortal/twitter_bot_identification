# twitter_bot_identification
This repository contains a regressor and classifier in R for identifying twitter bots through their account behvaiours.

The regressor predicts a bot_score for each account and identifies any account with bot_score > 0.5 as an bot account.

The classifier classifies an account into either a bot account or normal account.
